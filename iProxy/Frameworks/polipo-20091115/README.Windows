Building Polipo on Windows -*-text-*-
**************************

There are two distinct ports of Polipo to Windows -- a port using the
Cygwin emulation libraries, and an experimental native port using Mingw.

The Cygwin port is identical to the Unix binary.  Build it just like
you would build under Unix -- just type ``make all'' in the directory
where you untarred the Polipo sources.

In order to build the native port, cd to the Polipo directory, and do

  make EXE=.exe LDLIBS=-lwsock32

or, if you've got a regex library,

  make EXE=.exe EXTRA_DEFINES=-DHAVE_REGEX LDLIBS="-lwsock32 -lregex"

In order to cross-compile from a Unix system, you will probably need
to point make at the right compiler:

  make EXE=.exe CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc LDLIBS=-lwsock32

The native port currently attempts to access files in locations that
are typical for a Unix system; for example, it will attempt to read a
configuration file /etc/polipo/config on the current drive.  You will
probably need to point it at your config file with an explicit ``-c''
command-line argument, and define at least the following configuration
variables:

  dnsNameServer
  diskCacheRoot
  forbiddenFile

Help with solving this issue would be very much appreciated.
